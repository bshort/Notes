As with most of these tales, the characters met in a Tavern -- the Ol' Bore Inn in Bessel run by the gregarious Garron. Theo, a quiet fighter, and Gim, a tiefling palandin, arrived road weary, but found food, song, and a few bits of information. Soon, the characters were hired by Kerowyn Hucrele (Who-cree-lay) to find her missing children (Talgen, a figher, and Sharwyn, a spellcaster). They had been accompanied by Sir Braford, a paladin of Pelor who wielded Shatterspike and a ranger, Karackas, on a misadventure into the Sunless Citadel. For their troubles, party members would each receive 250 gp if the children could be rescued or 125 gp for the children's signet rings (since Kerowyn was a practical sort of person).

After hearing the deeply moving music of Gakas, the party came together -- although with may disparate goals. Hyskosa (High-sko-sa) an old tinker with twinkling eyes, blessed the newly formed group...and promptly disappeared into the night.

Roland, the uncouth Bessel warden led by the half-elf Felosial, guided the party to the Cleft, where they descended a rope into into darkness below. Dispatching a few giant rats and encountering a trap or two, the party prevailed. But not without some injury, Indar, an elven monk, had a nasty bite on his leg, but Gim performed quick healing leaving only an angry red welt.

Upon entering the Sunless Citadel proper, the group found a few skeletons with magical arrows as well as an immovable locked dragon door.

Venturing further, the intrepid adventures encountered the whimpering Kobold, Meepo, who had lost his tribe's dragon, Calcryx. After ransacking the wrymling's den, Meepo led the group deeper into the Sunless Citadel to meet Yusdrayl (Ewes drawl).

The party now finds itself in Yusdral's throne room with Meepo prostrated on the ground and several elite Kobold guards on watch.

Yusdrayl blinks her eyes at your torchlight and smiling says "What brings sunlanders to our tribe's Holy Site of Ashardalon?" The kobolds chant softly "All hail Ashardalon!"

We're on the way to find the goblins and the dragon

There's a room with a dragon diving down over a fountain

Apparently the scary door says "Rebuke the dead, open the way"

The DM's recap:

As unlikely as it sounds, the party found themselves parleying with Yusdrayl (Ewes drawl), leader of tribe of Kobolds who had recently taken up residence within the Sunless Citadel. The kobolds are at war with the goblin tribe, Durbuluk, which had stolen the kobold's dragon, Calcryx. The kobold dragon handler, Meepo, was convinced that the party could help rescue the dragon and a deal was struck -- for return of the dragon, Yusdrayl would grant the party safe passage through the kobold territory with Meepo as a guide to enter the "backdoor" of the goblin territory. Although some in the party wanted a different bargain, they were largely ignored...

Multiple attempts to secure a map of the Sunless Citadel were for naught.

Roland bravely offered to keep an eye on the Kobolds during the party's excursion. He would blow three sharp notes on his Warden's Horn of Bessel should there be any treachery. This did not happen...yet.

Meepo showed "Tall-Gim's" party to a room with a scary door (embossed with skeletal dragons and a hint of undead) and a fountain (also decorated with dragons and a Draconic rune). Luckily, Meepo could read Draconic and after proudly speaking "Let there be fire" the fountain expelled a potion of fire breathing which Gim secured in a flask despite Meepo's attempts to drink it. The party noted the skeletal door for later.

Continuing to north, the group dispatched several giant rats without incident. A thorough search of the rats nests located some odd coins and a few gems of low quality. The party found another fountain room with several "sprung" traps and a door. Unable to read the draconic rune on this similarly dragon-decorated fountain, the party noted human footprints along with many giant rat footprints. Following the bulk of the human footprints, the party ignored a door in the room and headed back south and to the west.

Finally becoming cautious, Gim slowly opened a door but failed to notice the bell attached on the other side. The long corridor was covered in caltrops and had a three foot high wall at the end hiding three goblins who popped up and with crackerjack accuracy put arrows into Gim, Indar, and Gakas. Gakas used his arcane powers and a touch of dust from the floor putting all the goblins to sleep.

After clearing the caltrops with giant rat corpses (Indar) and defiling the goblin corpses (Meepo), the group continued into the next room.

It was an practice archery range with humanoid dummies. Not as surprised this time, Gakas was able to put two out of the three goblins to sleep. After a blow from Theo, the remaining goblin ran from the room. Indar and Theo cornered the goblin in the store room where Tharg promptly surrendered. At first, it wasn't clear how to secure Tharg, but it turns out that Gim had a pair of manacles. Several questions went unasked and unanswered. Gim took oil from the storeroom, but turned his nose up at "Elfish Pudding".

Tharg was pretty much willing to tell the party anything they wanted from where the goblin's dragon was to where any humans might be. The party settled on being shown to where there were humans much to Meepo's dismay.

Tharg took the party to the stockade. After breaking the lock on the door, they freed four kobolds and a gnome, Erky Timbers. Erky is an acolyte of the Worldwanderer and had been captured on The Old Road a little over a month ago. He'd seen several of the humans in the adventuring party including the two siblings, who had been taken by a old, twisted spellcaster named Belak the Outcast to the Enchanted Grove below.

With time running short and the party somewhat injured, the group decided to return to kobald territory. After getting free of the goblin area, the party decided (after some debate) to free Tharg as promised. He scampered back towards goblin lands.

The party returned weary, wounded, and substantially larger (four extra kobolds and a gnome) to the Throneroom of Yusdrayl much to the relief of Roland, who had spent his time talking to the kobolds and wondering if his compatriots were going to return.
