# In the bar

A tinker? Scrawling in the notebook

?) Who's the guy in the corner? Maybe he's taking Notes?

The bartender likes Gakas's playing.


There's something killing cattle.

Garan - the Bartender

The herders are grazing too far out.
Marauding by night.

Sir Brathard? - Here about a month ago.

His ssword was shatterspike?


Hercrule's mother? - Rescue party



Belloc - 13 years ago was here - Todd is looking for him



Woman comes in with working clothes



# Carowyn Hercrule - Who the bartender mentioned

Talgryn(figher) and Sharwyn (wizard)are her kids - went adventuring with a ranger (carakas) and the paladin (Sir Brathard)

Sunless Citadel was their destination

Infested with... soemthing

Gone for a month

Salvage rights - especially if we can return her children - they had a writ from the town

Double if the children are returned


Belloc was also looking for the sunles citadel

Second session

Yusdral is the Kobold king guy


We're on the way to find the goblins and the dragon

There's a room with a dragon diving down over a fountain


Meepo knows some phrase in draconic that made the statue spit orange fluid

Apparently the scary door says "Rebuke the dead, open the way"


6 doors - ajar
smells musty

...

Another diving dragon statue

*room with Caltrops

3ft high wall on the other sidehttps://collider.com/jack-reacher-amazon-series-details/



*** After the goblins

"Balsig" is the ...something... of the Goblins


Goblin's name is...


# The Gnome
Acaloyte Erki Timbers

In a cage
Three humans caught a month ago
Talgyn
Sherwyn
Sir Bofwyn

Only kept a week before taken somewhere else


Golfias tree? What could that be? The gnome thinks there's a fruit that grows from it.
